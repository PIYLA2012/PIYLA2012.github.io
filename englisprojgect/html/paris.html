    <h1 class="lol">Paris</h1>
    <p class="loh">Paris is the capital of France, the most important economic and cultural center of the country, located in the northern part of central France, in the Ile-de-France region on the banks of the Seine River.
         In addition, Paris is of great international importance - the headquarters of UNESCO, the OECD and the International Chamber of Commerce are located here.</p>
         <img src="../img/P5.jpg">
        <p class="loh">I think that Paris is a very beautiful city. Paris has many attractions and beautiful places. Paris is also the capital of France. I'd like to see the Eiffel Tower and eat croissants. </p>
